# High level process flow:
1.  download zip file from URL<br/>
2.  extract zip file to temp folder<br/>
3.  build the test data set:<br/>
     1.  read "X_test.txt" into data frame<br/>
     2.  use "features.txt" for column names<br/>
     3.  decode activity index from "Y_test.txt" with data from "activity_labels.txt", prepend this as the first data column.<br/>
4.  build the training data set:<br/>
     1.  read "X_train.txt" into data frame<br/>
     2.  use "features.txt" for column names<br/>
     3.  decode activity index from "Y_train.txt" with data from "activity_labels.txt", prepend this as the first data column.<br/>
5.  Merge the test and traiing data sets<br/>
6.  subset the merged data to included 2 attribute columns (subject, activity) and then only data columns with "mean" or "std" in the column name.  This is the mergedData set.<br/>
7.  create a new tidyData set with column means for all numberic columns.  This is the "tidyData" set.<br/>

# Automated Script: 'run_analysis.R'
All of this data reduction is automated in the script "run_analysis.R".  To execute, do the following:<br/>
1.  import script: source("run_analysis.R")<br/>
2.  run script: main()<br/>

# Resulting global objects:
**mergedData** = merged and reduced data set of 10299 observations (rows) and 81 variables (columns)<br/>
**tidyData** = summarized data with 40 observations (rows) and 81 variables.  Each row is a group mean by subject and activity.<br/>

# Resulting data file:
**tidyData.txt** is the summarized data file, it will be in your working directory.<br/>
